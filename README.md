# Sequencing_bioinformatic_pipelines
 Scripts and reference files needed to make consensus sequences for Influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. 
 Includes scripts for both miseq and nextseq platforms for Influenza and SARS-CoV-2. 
 RSV only has scripts for the nextseq. Subdirectories include additional READMEs with details for each pipeline.
 Scripts for moving and renaming raw fastq files are in common_scripts. The appropriate scripts need to be moved to the specific viral subdirectory. For renaming the fastq files there is a script for nextseq runs, miseq runs, and any runs performed by the advanced genomics core._
